Differences between Javascript and Node js are-

1.JavaScript is a high level programming language but Node js is a javasript runtime. Which helps  us to run javascript in our server.
2.We can add HTML  tags in javascript and run DOM in browser but in Node js we can not connect HTML tags with it.
3.It is a programming language and it can run in any browser that has a browser engine , where node js is a JavaScript interpreter and environment with some valuable libraries that JavaScript programming can use directly.

	It is a programming language. It works in any browser that has a proper browser engine.


It is basically used on the client-side.	It is mostly used on the server-side.
